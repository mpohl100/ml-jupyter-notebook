# Jupyter notebook to demo the machine learning project to automate neural network engineering
You can run this jupyter notebook locally to get to know the usage of my [machine learning project](https://github.com/mpohl100/ml_rust).
I encourage you to make use of Visual Studio Code and use the dev container. That way I can automate the necessary installations for you.
If you are not on Ubuntu or don't have docker you can install Rust, Python 3 and install the requirements.txt pip packages to use the jupyter notebook.
